> “We’ll see what we see when we get there.”

The job of *maker* is two-fold: making the thing and communicating that you made it. In an effort to spotlight *what we do*, we’ve resolved to open-source as much as possible about *how we do it*.

## Separation of Powers
### 🛰️ A-TEMP® Communications
Our work is not created in a vacuum. Though we eschew explanations, dialogue is our governing benchmark of success. A-TEMP® Communications exists solely to facilitate conversations about our work.

### ⚙️ A-TEMP® Logistics
We strive to maximally eliminate the friction from idea to object and object to audience. Logistics are hard and often inglorious, but when done right are a thing of beauty. As a rule of thumb, when undertaking any logistical operation we act as if we are Jeff Bezos, though without the small dick complex that drives him to assholish behavior.

### 📒 A-TEMP® Publishing
The great writers of history’s command of their medium inspires us to achieve parallel mastery in all we do. Naturally, as a tribute to those — like Borges — who wind back metaphor to their earliest instantiations, we maintain an in-house publishing operation to distribute all text pertaining to the objects we make.

### 🖨️ Full Court Press
To compliment our publishing house, we run a small print production operation tasked with making all studio books and zines.

### 👁️ Optimistic Optics & Co.
Though we don’t believe in intellectual property, we do benefit from it. As such, It’s important for us to maintain and license images of our work for use by others.

### 🌹 Rrose Enterprises
The aesthetic is a loaded weapon — wielding it requires respect and care. This is the undertaking of Rrose Enterprises, A-TEMP® Studio’s and William W. Marx’s personal art practice. Specializing in bricolage, we work across media… wherever the ideas take us.

### 🪄 Something’s Missing, LLC
We believe the pinnacle of creation is collaboration. To successfully work with others in creating things better than could be done individually is what separates us from the cows in the field. All design work and work for others falls under this umbrella.

### 🕰️ Turing Time Technologies
Machines enable much of what we do. They expand our ability to connect to each other. The people that work most with them, though, often spread the virus that is perceived obsolescence. T³ is our response to this — smart technology that doesn’t hide its humanity.
